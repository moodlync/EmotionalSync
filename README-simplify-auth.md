# MoodLync Simplified Authentication

The simplified authentication system has been successfully implemented and tested. This system focuses on the core authentication functionality without the complexity of the full system.

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Simplified Authentication System**
   - Created `simplified-auth.ts` with streamlined auth logic
   - Created `simplified-storage.ts` for basic user management
   - Implemented proper password hashing with scrypt

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/register` - Create a new account
   - `/api/login` - Authenticate a user
   - `/api/user` - Get the current user's profile
   - `/api/logout` - End the user's session
   - `/api/healthcheck` - Check system health

3. **Test Tools**
   - Created a browser-based test page at `/simplified-auth-test.html`
   - Implemented an automated test script with `test-simple-auth.js`
   - Added a shell script to start the simplified server

## How to Use

1. Start the simplified auth server:
   ```
   ./start-simple-auth-server.sh
   ```

2. Open the test page in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/simplified-auth-test.html
   ```

3. Run the automated tests:
   ```
   node test-simple-auth.js
   ```

## Test Results

All tests have passed successfully:
- ✅ Health check endpoint works
- ✅ User registration functions properly
- ✅ Login authentication succeeds
- ✅ User profile retrieval works
- ✅ Logout functions correctly
- ✅ Protected routes are properly restricted after logout

## Next Steps

1. Integrate this simplified authentication system into the main application
2. Add role-based access control
3. Implement email verification (if needed)
4. Add password reset functionality

## Technical Notes

- The system uses in-memory storage for development
- Sessions are properly managed
- Passwords are securely hashed with scrypt
- Error handling is implemented throughout the system
