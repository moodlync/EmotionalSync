Prevent user data: 

 

1. Data Encryption 

End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) 

Encrypt all user chats, mood logs, and journal entries in transit and at rest (e.g., AES-256). 

Use Signal Protocol for real-time messaging. 

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) 

Allow users to verify milestones (e.g., "30-day streak") without exposing raw data (useful for Emotion NFTs). 

2. Privacy by Design 

Minimal Data Collection 

Only store essential data (e.g., no GPS pins—use approximate location for heatmaps). 

Let users pseudonymize profiles (no real names required). 

On-Device Processing 

Run AI mood detection locally (e.g., TensorFlow Lite) when possible to avoid cloud leaks. 

3. Compliance & Standards 

GDPR/CCPA Compliance 

Explicit consent for data sharing (e.g., family plan mood tracking). 

One-click data export/deletion (via admin panel). 

HIPAA (If offering therapy integrations) 

Encrypt therapist-patient chats + audit logs. 

4. Secure Authentication 

Biometric Logins 

Face ID/fingerprint + fallback to hardware keys (YubiKey). 

Anti-Bruteforce 

Rate-limiting + CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts. 

5. Blockchain for Transparency 

Immutable Consent Logs 

Store user permissions (e.g., "Share data with therapist") on a private blockchain (Hyperledger). 

NFT Privacy 

Mint Emotion NFTs as soulbound tokens (non-transferable) to prevent exploitation. 

6. Threat Mitigation 

Regular Penetration Testing 

Hire ethical hackers to probe for vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10). 

Real-Time Monitoring 

Detect anomalies (e.g., 100 API calls/sec from one IP) with AWS GuardDuty or Sentry. 

7. User Control & Transparency 

Privacy Dashboard 

Let users see/revoke third-party access (e.g., Google Fit integration). 

Open-Source Audits 

Publish security whitepapers and allow community code reviews. 

8. Backup & Recovery 

Distributed Backups 

Use geo-redundant storage (AWS S3 + Glacier) with 7-day rollback. 

Ransomware Protection 

Immutable backups + air-gapped copies for critical data. 

 

Example Workflow: Secure Mood Logging 

User journals "Feeling anxious today." 

Data is encrypted on device → sent via TLS 1.3. 

Stored in sharded databases (e.g., Firebase + MongoDB Atlas). 

Family plan members see only aggregate stats ("Anxiety: 20% ↑") unless explicit consent is given.
