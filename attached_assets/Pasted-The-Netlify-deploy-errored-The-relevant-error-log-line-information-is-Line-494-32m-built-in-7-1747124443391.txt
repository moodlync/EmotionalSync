Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis:
The build failure is due to a missing file `mood-hub` in the `dist/client` directory. This causes the build script to return a non-zero exit code.

The error message indicates:
- Expected: `200 dist/client/mood-hub`
- Actual: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/build/repo/dist/client/mood-hub'`

Additionally, the plugin `netlify-plugin-checklinks` failed to run properly due to errors in checking links.

### Solution:
1. Check the build script to ensure that it properly generates the `mood-hub` file in the `dist/client` directory.
2. Verify that the necessary file `mood-hub` is part of the build output and is correctly generated during the build process.
3. If the file is missing, investigate the build process and configuration to ensure the file is included and built correctly.

Once the `mood-hub` file is correctly generated in the `dist/client` directory, the build should be able to complete successfully.
