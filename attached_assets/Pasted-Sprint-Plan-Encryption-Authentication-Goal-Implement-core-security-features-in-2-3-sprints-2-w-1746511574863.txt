Sprint Plan: Encryption & Authentication

Goal: Implement core security features in 2-3 sprints (2-week cycles).

Sprint 1: Encryption Foundation

Tasks:

HTTPS/TLS Setup
Acquire SSL cert (Let’s Encrypt).
Enforce HTTPS redirect (Nginx/Apache config).
Definition of Done (DoD): All routes show "Secure" in browser.
Database Encryption
Configure AES-256 encryption for:
User profiles (email, name).
Mood logs/journal entries.
Tools: AWS RDS Encryption or SQLCipher (local).
DoD: Verified via SELECT pgp_sym_decrypt() (PostgreSQL) or equivalent.
E2EE for Journals
Generate user-specific keys (WebCrypto API).
Encrypt/decrypt client-side before DB storage.
DoD: Test with dummy data → ciphertext in DB, plaintext only in-app.
Sprint 2: Authentication Hardening

Tasks:

MFA Integration
Add TOTP (Google Authenticator) via speakeasy or Auth0.
UI: "Enable MFA" toggle in settings + QR scanner.
DoD: Users can enroll and log in with MFA.
Biometric Auth
Implement WebAuthn for Face ID/fingerprint.
Fallback to PIN if unsupported.
DoD: Works on iOS/Android browsers.
Role-Based Access
Define roles (user, admin, therapist).
Middleware to block unauthorized API calls.
DoD: Admins can access dashboard; users cannot.
Sprint 3: Testing & Compliance

Tasks:

Penetration Testing
Run OWASP ZAP scans for SQLi/XSS.
Fix critical issues (e.g., sanitize inputs).
Audit Logs
Log all auth attempts/data access.
Store in SIEM (e.g., AWS CloudTrail).
Compliance Documentation Templates

1. Privacy Policy (GDPR/CCPA)

[Your Company Name]
Last Updated: [Date]

Data Collected:

Email, mood logs, journal entries (encrypted).
Purpose: Personalization, analytics (opt-in).
User Rights:

Request data access/deletion via [Settings > Privacy].
CCPA: Opt out of data sales [here].
Security Measures:

AES-256 encryption, MFA, annual audits.
Third Parties:

AWS (hosting), Firebase (auth). DPAs available on request.
2. Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

Between: [Your Company] & [Vendor, e.g., AWS]

Scope:

Vendor processes user data per Appendix A.
Security Obligations:

Encryption, breach notification (<72 hrs).
Termination:

Vendor deletes data upon contract end.
3. Breach Response Plan

Detection: Monitor logs/SIEM alerts.
Containment: Disable compromised accounts.
Notification:
GDPR: Report to DPA within 72 hrs.
CCPA: Notify users if SSN/financial data exposed.
4. Consent Management Template (UI)

html
<div class="consent-banner">  
  <p>We use cookies for analytics. Accept?</p>  
  <button id="accept">Accept</button>  
  <button id="reject">Reject</button>  
  <a href="/privacy">Details</a>  
</div>  
<script>  
  // Log preference to DB and set cookie.  
</script>
Tools to Accelerate Development

Encryption: AWS KMS, OpenSSL.
Auth: Auth0, Firebase Auth.
Compliance: OneTrust (automated policy updates).
Next Steps:

Assign sprint tasks to devs (e.g., Alice owns E2EE).
Draft policies using templates → legal review.
