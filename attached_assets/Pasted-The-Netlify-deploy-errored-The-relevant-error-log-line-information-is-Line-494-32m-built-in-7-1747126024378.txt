Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the following error:
- [91mâœ– FAIL load dist/client/mood-hub[39m
- [91m|[39m[96m operator:[39m load
- [91m|[39m[96m expected:[39m 200 dist/client/mood-hub
- [91m|[39m[96m   actual:[39m ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/build/repo/dist/client/mood-hub'
- [91m|[39m[96m       at:[39m dist/client/direct-mood-selector.html:535:18 <a href="/mood-hub">...</a>[39m
- Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2

**Solution:**
1. Check that the file `mood-hub` is correctly set up and generated in the `dist/client` directory during the build process.
2. Ensure that the file `mood-hub` is included in the build script and is generated before it is being accessed.
3. Verify that the correct path to `mood-hub` is used in the code, considering the actual file structure generated by the build process.
