PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. If your web app handles credit/debit card transactions (even through third-party processors like Stripe or PayPal), PCI compliance is mandatory.

Key PCI DSS Requirements for Web Apps

Secure Network
Use firewalls to protect cardholder data.
Avoid storing sensitive data (CVV, full card numbers) unless necessary.
Encryption
TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS) for all data in transit.
AES-256 encryption for stored cardholder data.
Access Control
Role-Based Access (RBAC) for admin panels.
Unique IDs + MFA for anyone accessing payment data.
Vulnerability Management
Regular penetration testing (annual requirement).
Patch systems against known vulnerabilities.
Monitoring & Logging
Track all access to payment data.
Logs must be retained for at least 1 year.
Third-Party Compliance
If using Stripe/PayPal, ensure they are PCI Level 1 certified.
Never store CVV after authorization.
PCI Compliance Prompt for Web App Development
Objective: Ensure the web app meets PCI DSS standards for handling payment data securely.
1. Secure Payment Processing
* Do NOT store full credit card numbers, CVV, or magnetic stripe data.
* Use PCI-compliant processors (Stripe, PayPal, Braintree) with embedded iframes/APIs.
* Tokenize payments (replace card data with tokens for future transactions).
2. Encryption & Network Security
* Enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) with HSTS headers.
* Disable weak ciphers (SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1).
* Encrypt stored data (AES-256) if handling partial cardholder info (e.g., last 4 digits).
3. Access & Authentication
* MFA required for admin access to payment logs.
* RBAC implementation – restrict payment data access to only necessary roles.
* Session timeout: 15 minutes of inactivity.
4. Logging & Monitoring
* Log all payment transactions (success/failures).
* Alert on suspicious activity (e.g., multiple failed payments).
* Store logs securely (encrypted, immutable).
5. Vulnerability Management
* Quarterly ASV scans (Approved Scanning Vendor).
* Annual penetration testing (required for PCI Level 1).
* Automated dependency checks (e.g., npm audit, Snyk).
6. Compliance Documentation
* Maintain an AOC (Attestation of Compliance) if handling payments directly.
* Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) if using Stripe/PayPal (likely SAQ A or SAQ A-EP).

Example Implementation for MoodSync
* Payment Flow:
    * Use Stripe Elements (PCI-DSS compliant).
    * Tokenize cards → store only last4 + brand for UX.
* Admin Panel:
    * Mask card details in logs (****-****-****-4242).
    * Require MFA + IP whitelisting for finance team.
* Logging:
    * AWS CloudTrail + GuardDuty for anomaly detection.

Prompt for Developers


"Build a PCI-compliant payment system for MoodSync where:  
1. Users can subscribe via credit card without exposing full PAN/CVV.  
2. Admins can view only masked card details (last4 digits).  
3. All transactions are logged securely with audit trails.  
4. Penetration tests are run annually, and ASV scans quarterly.  
5. Stripe handles PCI compliance (SAQ A), but our app enforces HTTPS, MFA, and encryption for logs."  
Next Steps:
1. Integrate Stripe.js (PCI SAQ A compliant).
2. Set up SIEM monitoring (Splunk/ELK).
3. Schedule ASV scans (e.g., Qualys, Trustwave).

PCI DSS Compliance Implementation Prompt
Objective: Build a secure payment system that meets PCI DSS standards while integrating with third-party processors (Stripe/PayPal).
Core Requirements:
1. Data Handling
    * Never store full credit card numbers, CVV, or magnetic stripe data
    * If storing, only keep:
        * Last 4 digits of card (masked as ****-****-****-4242)
        * Card brand/type (Visa, Mastercard)
        * Expiration month/year (if required for recurring payments)
2. Secure Transmission
    * Enforce TLS 1.2+ across entire application
    * Implement HSTS headers with 180-day minimum
    * Disable SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1
3. Payment Processing
    * Use PCI-compliant iframe solutions:
        * Stripe Elements
        * Braintree Hosted Fields
        * PayPal Smart Payment Buttons
    * Tokenize all payment methods before processing
4. Access Control
    * Implement RBAC for payment-related functions:
        * Tier 1: Customer (can view own payment methods)
        * Tier 2: Support (can refund, no card data access)
        * Tier 3: Finance (limited masked data access)
    * Require MFA for all admin accounts
5. Monitoring & Logging
    * Log all payment events with:
        * Timestamp
        * User ID
        * Action type
        * Amount
        * Last 4 digits of card
    * Retain logs for minimum 1 year (encrypted at rest)
6. Vulnerability Management
    * Schedule quarterly ASV scans
    * Conduct annual penetration tests
    * Implement automated dependency scanning (npm audit, Snyk)
7. Third-Party Compliance
    * Use only PCI Level 1 certified providers
    * Maintain current Attestation of Compliance (AOC) documents
    * Complete appropriate SAQ annually (likely SAQ A or A-EP)
Implementation Checklist:
* Configure WAF rules for payment endpoints
* Implement CSP headers to prevent injection attacks
* Set up automated certificate rotation
* Create data flow diagrams for PCI audit
* Document encryption key management procedures
Example Code Snippet (Stripe Integration):
javascript

// Server-side
const stripe = require('stripe')(API_KEY);
app.post('/payment', async (req, res) => {
  const paymentMethod = await stripe.paymentMethods.create({
    type: 'card',
    card: req.body.token // From Stripe Elements
  });
  // Store only paymentMethod.id + last4
});
Deliverables:
1. Architecture diagram showing payment data flow
2. Completed Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)
3. Evidence of quarterly vulnerability scans
4. Incident response plan for payment data breaches
Exclusions:
* Physical security requirements (if no on-prem servers)
* Point-of-sale systems (for web-only applications)
Next Steps:
1. Select PCI-compliant payment processor
2. Schedule initial ASV scan
3. Train developers on secure coding practices
