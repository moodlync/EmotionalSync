Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
The build failed at line 532 with the following error:
```
FAIL load dist/public/mood-hub
operator: load
expected: 200 dist/public/mood-hub
actual: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/build/repo/dist/public/mood-hub'
```
This error indicates that the file `dist/public/mood-hub` is expected but not found during the build process.

### Solution
1. Verify that the `mood-hub` file is correctly generated in the `dist/public` directory as expected.
2. If the file is missing, ensure that the build script correctly generates the `mood-hub` file.
3. If the file is present locally but not correctly deployed to Netlify, review the publish settings to ensure the file is included in the deployment.
4. Check if there are any special configurations in the build script that might be affecting the generation or deployment of the `mood-hub` file.
