Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by a permission denied error when trying to execute the `netlify-build.sh` script.

**Solution:**
1. **Verify Permission:** Ensure that the `netlify-build.sh` script has executable permission. You can do this by running `chmod +x netlify-build.sh` to add the executable permission.
2. If the script is not in the repository, add it to the repository and commit the changes. 
3. Make sure the script is in the root directory or the correct path specified in the `build.command` configuration.
4. Retry the build after making these changes.
