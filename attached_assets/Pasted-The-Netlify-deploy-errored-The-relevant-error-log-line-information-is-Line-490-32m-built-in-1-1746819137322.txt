Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
[line 507](#L507): The build failed due to a user error with a non-zero exit code, specifically code 2. The error message indicates that a Netlify Function failed to require a local file.

### Solution
1. The file 'api.js' is looking for a module './routes' but cannot find it in the '/opt/build/repo/server' directory.
2. Verify that the file 'routes.js' exists in the expected location.
3. Ensure that the path to the 'routes.js' file is correctly spelled relative to the 'api.js' file.
4. If the 'routes.js' file is missing, add it to the '/opt/build/repo/server' directory and commit the changes to the repository.
