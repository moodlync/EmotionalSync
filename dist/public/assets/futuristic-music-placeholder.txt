This is a placeholder for the futuristic-music.mp3 file.

To make the background music feature work properly, you need to:

1. Add an MP3 audio file named "futuristic-music.mp3" to the /client/public/assets/ directory
2. The audio should have futuristic music that complements the app's theme about emotional connections
3. The music should be royalty-free or properly licensed for your use

The background music controls have already been set up in the welcome page.
