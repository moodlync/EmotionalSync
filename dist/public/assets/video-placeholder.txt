This is a placeholder for the app-features.mp4 file.

In production, you'll need to replace this with an actual promotional video file saved as:
/client/public/assets/app-features.mp4

The video should showcase the following features in this order:
1. Emotion-Based Matching (0-10 seconds)
2. Live Emotional Pulse Map (10-20 seconds)
3. Mood-Based Chat Rooms (20-30 seconds)
4. AI Emotional Support (30-40 seconds)
5. Premium Features (40-50 seconds)
6. Gamification & Rewards (50-60 seconds)

The video component is designed to synchronize UI elements with these timecodes.
