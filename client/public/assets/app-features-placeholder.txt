This is a placeholder for the app-features.mp4 file.

For the welcome page video to work properly, you need to:

1. Add an MP4 video file named "app-features.mp4" to the /client/public/assets/ directory
2. The video should have an audio track with futuristic music that complements the app's theme

The poster image and controls for the video have already been set up.
